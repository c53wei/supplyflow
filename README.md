# SupplyFlow
Thank you for viewing our project!

# About
The goal of this project is to improve the distribution of supplies (toiletries, feminine hygiene products, etc.) to women's and children's shelters in the Kitchener-Waterloo region. Throughout this hackathon, our main priorities were to gain an introduction to front-end tools and practice modularized coding habits. 

# Codebase
In this repo, we included all C# files in [here] (./src) which parses organization information, computes distance & weight calculations, and outputs results. These files are divided up by class, and then further divided by method function. Also, we included the JavaScript and HTML files that make up our website's basic functionality can be found [here] (./web). There are a few options on each webpage to click. 

Thanks for having us!
